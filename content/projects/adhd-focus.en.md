## Project Overview

This is a minimalist focus timer website designed specifically for people with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). The project was inspired by my personal experience - discovering that ADHD focus music genuinely helps me calm down and maintain concentration.

- Intuitive circular progress display
- Hover on outer ring to set time
- Click outer ring to start timing

### üéµ Integrated Background Music
- Carefully curated ADHD focus music
- Smooth background audio playback
- Audio controls integrated with timer

### ‚è∞ Flexible Time Management
- Quick preset options (5, 15, 25, 45 minutes)
- Custom time setting via hover interaction
- Visual and audio completion notifications

### üì± Responsive Design
- Optimized for mobile and desktop
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Dark/light theme support

## Technical Implementation

Built with modern web technologies:
- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Hooks** for state management
- **Web Audio API** for background music

## Design Philosophy

The design follows ADHD-friendly principles:
- **Minimal visual noise** to reduce distractions
- **Single-focus interaction** - one primary action at a time
- **Immediate feedback** for all user interactions
- **Soothing color palette** to promote calmness
