## Why

This is a minimalist focus timer website. The project was inspired by my personal experience — I always find it hard to start tasks, and even harder to stop once I've started. Then I accidentally discovered that after turning on this background music, I was really able to immerse myself and work for two solid hours. The original music was on YouTube, but it would pause every so often and couldn't be controlled, so I spent a day implementing this idea that was in my head.

## What

- Peaceful forest background
- Background music designed specifically for ADHD
- Minimalist timer with no distractions

## How

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js 14**: Modern React framework providing excellent performance
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, improving development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Core Features
- Optimized client-side rendering
- Smooth animation effects
- Integrated audio controls
- Consistent cross-device experience

## Development Motivation

As someone with ADHD, I deeply understand the limitations of traditional timers for us:

- **Overly complex interfaces** easily distract attention
- **Lack of ambient creation** makes it difficult to enter a focused state
- **Cumbersome operation steps** affect user experience

ADHDFocus was born to solve these pain points.
