## Why - Product Thinking from Personal Pain Points

As someone preparing for CELPIP, I experienced firsthand the pain points of existing learning tools:

**Repetitive Manual Processes**: Having to copy-paste the same prompts to ChatGPT every time, then paste essays back and forth - the entire workflow was tedious and interrupted my focus.

**Lack of Specificity**: Generic AI tools couldn't provide CELPIP-specific scoring standards and feedback formats.

**Scattered Resources**: Official sample answers, practice questions, and scoring criteria were scattered across different sources without a unified practice environment.

As a former product manager at a major tech company, my first instinct wasn't to find better alternatives, but to think: could I build a product that truly solves these problems?

Once this idea emerged, I realized this was an excellent learning opportunity - to experience the complete web development process while building something I actually needed.

## What - From Requirements to Implementation

Based on my own pain points, I outlined the core requirements:

### 🎯 Core Features
- **Unified Writing Environment**: Question selection, writing, scoring, and feedback all in one page
- **Intelligent AI Scoring**: Using OpenAI API to provide 1-12 scale evaluation based on CELPIP standards
- **Real-time Writing Suggestions**: Direct highlighting in text for areas needing improvement
- **Official Sample Reference**: 90+ sample answers across different score ranges for comparison learning

### 📊 Data Management
- **Practice Records**: Save each writing session and scores for progress tracking
- **User System**: Simple authentication to manage personal learning data
- **Question Bank**: Categorization and search functionality for 46+ official questions

### 💡 Product Details
From a product manager's perspective, I particularly focused on experience details:
- Auto-save functionality to prevent content loss
- Responsive design for consistent experience across devices
- Loading states and error handling to keep users informed
- Clear information hierarchy with important details at a glance

## How - Technical Implementation & Architecture

While my primary background is product management, I took on the full-stack development role in this project, handling everything from product design to technical implementation.

### 🏗 Technical Architecture Design

#### Frontend Tech Stack
- **Next.js 14**: Chose App Router architecture for unified frontend/backend handling
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety to reduce runtime errors
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid responsive interface construction
- **Slate.js**: Rich text editor supporting real-time correction highlighting

#### Backend & Data
- **API Routes**: Next.js native API routing for business logic
- **Vercel Postgres**: Cloud-native database with auto-scaling
- **Clerk Authentication**: Enterprise-grade authentication solution
- **OpenAI Integration**: AI evaluation service integration

#### Database Design
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT,
  usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 30
);

-- Score history table
CREATE TABLE score_history (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT,
  question TEXT,
  essay TEXT,
  ai_response JSONB,
  ai_corrections JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 🔧 Core Feature Implementation

#### Dual-Phase AI Assessment System
Based on product requirements, I designed a separated scoring and suggestion system:

```typescript
// Phase 1: CELPIP Standard Scoring
const scoreResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "o1-mini",
  messages: [{
    role: "user", 
    content: celpipTeacherPrompt + userEssay
  }]
});

// Phase 2: Detailed Correction Suggestions
const correctionResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "o1-mini",
  messages: [{
    role: "user",
    content: celpipCommentsPrompt + userEssay
  }]
});
```

#### Intelligent State Management
Implemented global user state management to avoid duplicate API calls:
- Context-based state management
- Intelligent caching mechanism (30-second cache window)
- Automated user initialization

#### Rich Text Editor Integration
Used Slate.js to implement complex text highlighting functionality:
- Character index-based precise positioning
- Dynamic style rendering
- Real-time feedback display

### 🎯 From Product Design to Technical Implementation

From a product manager's perspective, I paid special attention to several technical implementation details:

**User Experience Optimization**:
- Proactive user initialization to eliminate new user errors
- Auto-save mechanism to prevent content loss
- Graceful error handling and loading states
- Responsive design for consistent cross-device experience

**Performance Optimization**:
- Global state caching to reduce API call frequency
- Component-level lazy loading
- Database query optimization
- CDN static asset deployment

### 🎯 Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: AI Scoring Accuracy & Stability**
OpenAI API response format instability was the biggest challenge. Through careful prompt engineering and JSON schema validation, I achieved stable structured output:
- Designed detailed scoring standard prompts
- Implemented JSON parsing fallback mechanisms
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff strategy

**Challenge 2: Complex State Management**
Multi-component state synchronization required architectural-level solutions:
- Implemented Context-based global state management
- Designed single source of truth architecture to avoid state desynchronization
- Introduced intelligent caching strategy to optimize API call frequency

**Challenge 3: Rich Text Editor Complex Interactions**
Implementing real-time highlighting for writing suggestions required deep Slate.js integration:
- Character index-based precise text positioning algorithm
- Custom renderer for dynamic styling
- Optimized rendering performance for large texts

**Challenge 4: UX Technical Implementation**
Converting product design to technical implementation with attention to detail:
- Designed proactive initialization architecture to eliminate new user error prompts
- Implemented auto-save mechanism and offline state handling
- Optimized loading states and error boundary user feedback
