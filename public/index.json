[{"content":"Why - Product Thinking from Personal Pain Points As someone preparing for CELPIP, I experienced firsthand the pain points of existing learning tools:\nRepetitive Manual Processes: Having to copy-paste the same prompts to ChatGPT every time, then paste essays back and forth - the entire workflow was tedious and interrupted my focus.\nLack of Specificity: Generic AI tools couldn\u0026rsquo;t provide CELPIP-specific scoring standards and feedback formats.\nScattered Resources: Official sample answers, practice questions, and scoring criteria were scattered across different sources without a unified practice environment.\nAs a former product manager at a major tech company, my first instinct wasn\u0026rsquo;t to find better alternatives, but to think: could I build a product that truly solves these problems?\nOnce this idea emerged, I realized this was an excellent learning opportunity - to experience the complete web development process while building something I actually needed.\nWhat - From Requirements to Implementation Based on my own pain points, I outlined the core requirements:\n🎯 Core Features Unified Writing Environment: Question selection, writing, scoring, and feedback all in one page Intelligent AI Scoring: Using OpenAI API to provide 1-12 scale evaluation based on CELPIP standards Real-time Writing Suggestions: Direct highlighting in text for areas needing improvement Official Sample Reference: 90+ sample answers across different score ranges for comparison learning 📊 Data Management Practice Records: Save each writing session and scores for progress tracking User System: Simple authentication to manage personal learning data Question Bank: Categorization and search functionality for 46+ official questions 💡 Product Details From a product manager\u0026rsquo;s perspective, I particularly focused on experience details:\nAuto-save functionality to prevent content loss Responsive design for consistent experience across devices Loading states and error handling to keep users informed Clear information hierarchy with important details at a glance How - Technical Implementation \u0026amp; Architecture While my primary background is product management, I took on the full-stack development role in this project, handling everything from product design to technical implementation.\n🏗 Technical Architecture Design Frontend Tech Stack Next.js 14: Chose App Router architecture for unified frontend/backend handling TypeScript: Full type safety to reduce runtime errors Tailwind CSS: Rapid responsive interface construction Slate.js: Rich text editor supporting real-time correction highlighting Backend \u0026amp; Data API Routes: Next.js native API routing for business logic Vercel Postgres: Cloud-native database with auto-scaling Clerk Authentication: Enterprise-grade authentication solution OpenAI Integration: AI evaluation service integration Database Design -- Users table CREATE TABLE users ( id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT, usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 30 ); -- Score history table CREATE TABLE score_history ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id TEXT, question TEXT, essay TEXT, ai_response JSONB, ai_corrections JSONB, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() ); 🔧 Core Feature Implementation Dual-Phase AI Assessment System Based on product requirements, I designed a separated scoring and suggestion system:\n// Phase 1: CELPIP Standard Scoring const scoreResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({ model: \u0026#34;o1-mini\u0026#34;, messages: [{ role: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;, content: celpipTeacherPrompt + userEssay }] }); // Phase 2: Detailed Correction Suggestions const correctionResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({ model: \u0026#34;o1-mini\u0026#34;, messages: [{ role: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;, content: celpipCommentsPrompt + userEssay }] }); Intelligent State Management Implemented global user state management to avoid duplicate API calls:\nContext-based state management Intelligent caching mechanism (30-second cache window) Automated user initialization Rich Text Editor Integration Used Slate.js to implement complex text highlighting functionality:\nCharacter index-based precise positioning Dynamic style rendering Real-time feedback display 🎯 From Product Design to Technical Implementation From a product manager\u0026rsquo;s perspective, I paid special attention to several technical implementation details:\nUser Experience Optimization:\nProactive user initialization to eliminate new user errors Auto-save mechanism to prevent content loss Graceful error handling and loading states Responsive design for consistent cross-device experience Performance Optimization:\nGlobal state caching to reduce API call frequency Component-level lazy loading Database query optimization CDN static asset deployment System Architecture:\ncelpip/ ├── src/ │ ├── app/ # Next.js App Router │ │ ├── api/ # Backend API routes │ │ ├── writing/ # Writing practice page │ │ └── history/ # History page │ ├── components/ # React component library │ │ ├── Essay.tsx # Core editor component │ │ ├── Score.tsx # Score display component │ │ └── SampleAnswersPanel.tsx # Sample comparison panel │ ├── contexts/ # Global state management │ ├── hooks/ # Custom React hooks │ ├── lib/ # API wrappers and utilities │ └── data/ # Static data and configuration ├── public/ # Static assets └── vercel.json # Deployment configuration 🎯 Technical Challenges \u0026amp; Solutions Challenge 1: AI Scoring Accuracy \u0026amp; Stability OpenAI API response format instability was the biggest challenge. Through careful prompt engineering and JSON schema validation, I achieved stable structured output:\nDesigned detailed scoring standard prompts Implemented JSON parsing fallback mechanisms Added retry logic with exponential backoff strategy Challenge 2: Complex State Management Multi-component state synchronization required architectural-level solutions:\nImplemented Context-based global state management Designed single source of truth architecture to avoid state desynchronization Introduced intelligent caching strategy to optimize API call frequency Challenge 3: Rich Text Editor Complex Interactions Implementing real-time highlighting for writing suggestions required deep Slate.js integration:\nCharacter index-based precise text positioning algorithm Custom renderer for dynamic styling Optimized rendering performance for large texts Challenge 4: UX Technical Implementation Converting product design to technical implementation with attention to detail:\nDesigned proactive initialization architecture to eliminate new user error prompts Implemented auto-save mechanism and offline state handling Optimized loading states and error boundary user feedback 🚀 Project Results Technical Metrics Build Performance: Homepage 6.68KB, Writing page 80.8KB Response Time: AI scoring 15-30s, Interface response \u0026lt;100ms System Availability: 99.9% uptime Data Processing: Real-time search support for 90+ samples, 46+ questions Core Feature Implementation Intelligent Scoring Engine: Based on OpenAI o1-mini model, implemented dual-phase assessment system:\nComprehensive Scoring: Four-dimensional assessment following CELPIP 1-12 standards Detailed Corrections: Word-by-word analysis providing specific improvement suggestions Smart Sample Matching:\nAutomatic user question identification with relevant official sample matching Support for score range filtering and dynamic sorting Implemented efficient text retrieval algorithm User System:\nIntegrated Clerk enterprise authentication solution Designed complete user lifecycle management Implemented learning progress tracking and historical data analysis 💡 Learning Outcomes from Product Manager Perspective Complete Requirements-to-Implementation Loop: Experienced the full product development process from user pain point identification, to product requirements definition, to technical architecture design and code implementation.\nTechnical Decision-Making Ability: Learned to balance between functional requirements, development costs, and maintenance complexity, such as choosing Clerk over building custom authentication.\nFull-Stack Development Capability: Mastered the complete modern web development stack, capable of independently completing all development work from database to frontend.\nSystems Thinking: Understanding of software system complexity, including the importance of non-functional requirements like state management, error handling, and performance optimization.\n💼 Technical Value \u0026amp; Skills Demonstration This project fully demonstrates my comprehensive capabilities in the following technical areas:\nFull-Stack Development Capability Frontend Architecture: Deep application of React ecosystem, including state management, component design, performance optimization Backend Development: API design, database operations, third-party service integration System Design: Complete capability from requirements analysis to architectural design DevOps Practices: Modern deployment processes and production environment management AI/ML Integration Capability Prompt Engineering: Deep understanding of large language model usage methods and limitations API Integration: Complex third-party AI service integration and error handling Data Processing: Robust implementation of JSON parsing, formatting, and validation Product-Technology Integration User Experience Design: Translating product thinking into technical implementation details Performance Optimization: Technology optimization decisions based on user experience Error Handling: Product-level exception handling and user feedback Learning \u0026amp;

Next, I plan to:\nShort-term Optimization:\nAdd support for more question types Optimize AI scoring accuracy Add learning progress analysis features Skill Enhancement:\nLearn more frontend frameworks (Vue, Svelte, etc.) Understand backend development best practices Master data analysis and visualization skills Product Reflection: This project also made me reflect on the value of product managers. In the AI era, the ability to quickly transform ideas into prototypes becomes increasingly important. Product managers don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to become technical experts, but understanding the basic principles of technical implementation enables better product decisions.\n🤝 Final Thoughts This project started from personal pain points, learned technical knowledge, and ultimately implemented a complete product. While the code might not be elegant enough and the architecture not perfect, it solved my actual problem and became a valuable experience in learning new skills.\nFor other product managers wanting to learn technology, my advice is: don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated by technical complexity, start by solving your own small problems, stay curious, and dare to try. Development tools and learning resources today are more friendly than ever - with ideas, you can make them reality.\nImpact \u0026amp; Results:\nProblem Solving: Addressed a real market gap in CELPIP preparation tools Technical Innovation: Novel application of AI in language learning assessment User Value: Provided accessible, high-quality language learning assistance Code Quality: Production-ready codebase demonstrating professional development standards This project represents a comprehensive demonstration of modern full-stack development capabilities, AI integration expertise, and user-centered design principles—essential skills for senior positions in today\u0026rsquo;s technology landscape.\nProject Links: GitHub | Live Demo\nWelcome to try it out and provide feedback!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/celpip12/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"why---product-thinking-from-personal-pain-points\"\u003eWhy - Product Thinking from Personal Pain Points\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs someone preparing for CELPIP, I experienced firsthand the pain points of existing learning tools:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRepetitive Manual Processes\u003c/strong\u003e: Having to copy-paste the same prompts to ChatGPT every time, then paste essays back and forth - the entire workflow was tedious and interrupted my focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLack of Specificity\u003c/strong\u003e: Generic AI tools couldn\u0026rsquo;t provide CELPIP-specific scoring standards and feedback formats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScattered Resources\u003c/strong\u003e: Official sample answers, practice questions, and scoring criteria were scattered across different sources without a unified practice environment.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"CELPIP12 - From Personal Pain Point to Full-Stack AI Solution"},{"content":"Why This is a minimalist focus timer website.

Recently, I bought a domain for an independent product project, which sparked the idea to set up a blog again. Still using Hugo + GitHub, just like seven or eight years ago, though with many more convenient tools available now.\nThe Struggling Life of an Internet Product Manager After struggling in China\u0026rsquo;s internet industry for 6 years, I finally gave up and became what they call a \u0026ldquo;grassroots soldier who will never be promoted to P8\u0026rdquo;. In 6 years, I worked in 4 different teams, had 6-7-8 different bosses, experienced the last glimmer of the internet boom, and increasingly found myself unable to adapt to this environment.\nOver 6 years, the environment gradually deteriorated into a mess. Watching the last bit of internet prosperity disappear, every company internally promoted slogans like \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t just follow orders blindly,\u0026rdquo; but demanded subordinates to quickly respond to cases reported by bosses and their friends after work hours. From initially emphasizing user experience and doing the right thing, hearing these words in the workplace later became laughable.\nOver 6 years, I also discovered my own incompatibilities - not aggressive enough, unable to handle gray areas, unable to compete for work, unable to push others with deadlines. The result was internal conflict leading to emotional breakdown, while external collaborators and colleagues felt awkward too. Before my SSR, someone asked me: \u0026ldquo;Look at all the managers you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered in different companies - is there anyone with your personality?\u0026rdquo; I thought about it seriously for a long time and couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a single one. The only boss whose values I truly respected was also marginalized and didn\u0026rsquo;t have a good career path.\nIn such an environment with someone like me, relationships between people were tense, and the work was just polishing turds. Except for the salary, nothing could convince me to stay any longer. Initially, I thought I was unlucky to always encounter weird teams, but after talking to people from different companies, I found no one was happy. Perhaps they were stronger than me in their ability to endure, or maybe the generous income brought them worthwhile returns outside of work.\nThe Beginning of New Attempts Last year\u0026rsquo;s first gap year attempt changed my mindset a lot, and I made many psychological mistakes, never fully relaxing from beginning to end. Due to mortgage pressure and not having figured out the path to emigrate, I decided to find another \u0026ldquo;retirement factory\u0026rdquo; job without seeking promotion or raises. But the environment wasn\u0026rsquo;t as expected - when they\u0026rsquo;re paying you money that depends on who can kneel better, how would they let you stand alone? So this time, actively seeking layoffs became much easier. During the turmoil, I started learning Next.js to build websites and projects, and actually managed to create and launch something online (once again amazed at how front-end technology has evolved to let beginners easily build websites).\nThe project itself started in February, was paused for a long time due to prompt adjustment issues, until I had plenty of unsupervised free time before leaving my job. Working with GPT teacher step by step, I kept comforting myself throughout the process - treat it as a practice project, don\u0026rsquo;t overthink the final results.\nWhat will the path of independent products look like? I really don\u0026rsquo;t know. I remember when I decided to pursue product management in my second year of graduate school, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what the future would hold either. Fortunately, I now have some savings to keep experimenting and create my next chapter of life.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/027-2024-starting-blogging-again/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWriting blogs now might be as unnoticed as writing diaries on Douban.

终于看完了第二部晨间剧，相比上一部安藤樱的人物情节更丰富了一些，四十年的人生经历，回头看似乎可以分为离乡前的二十年单纯快乐，上京后开始自立，发现无法实现梦想，结婚离婚很多苦都以几年后这几个字带过仍然觉得那些时光太过低沉，也许成年后的快乐本身就是直线下降的吧，最后的鸡汤也是说像昨天一样继续活着，创造梦想。\n有村架纯的休工期 第二集太有共感了，摸摸头说着我懂你没有我你真的不行，被评论一点也不可爱你以后会嫁不出去，嘴炮之后很爽但还是会躺在床上怀疑自己会不会孤独终老\n柔情史 美太不真实了，你为什么分手，他们都太好了\n想见你 穿越这种烂到爆的梗也能拍的这么好看，从莫比乌斯环的循环和无法改变过去的选择，到内向的陈韵如面对外向的黄雨萱的自持，就想起前段时间自己反思的好朋友都是在自己阳光自信的时候交的，不需要强迫自己很努力但是充满光的人生太令人向往了，最后夸一句主演的颜值和演技！\n法制未来时 小妇人 行骗天下JP 每一集都很有意思哈哈哈\n婚姻生活 半梦半醒的人生 太喜欢这种话痨电影了，断断续续的看完，为了让大家能听的进去这些大段大段的对话而采用的这种动画的形式\n弗兰西丝·哈 20年第一部很戳心，文艺女青年的生活描述的很精准\n平原上的夏洛克 农村故事讲的很棒，素人演员细节处理的很好，房顶上的金鱼太浪漫了\nData source: Douban | Updated
